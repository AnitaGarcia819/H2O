#User Story
Good citizens will be able to report any sightings of 
the over usage of water anonymously. The user filing a 
report does not have an account and does not have to pay 
a fee to submit a sighting. The good citizen will begin 
by searching for a water agency in their area to confirm
their claim will be acted on. The good citizen, will begin 
their environmental stewardship by entering a short form 
that will include the address of the sighting, 
the type of claim, and whether the sighting is 
a business or residential home. Once the reporter of the 
claim submits report, they are able to submit another entry 
if they wish. The water agencies that are signed up on the 
H2O website will serve as the administrator of the webpage 
and will be able to resolve the reported claims, delete any claims, 
see the number of claims by zip code and the percentage of claims 
that have been resolved. The administrator will also be able
to add water agencies to the system.
